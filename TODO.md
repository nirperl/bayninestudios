### My To Do List for the Box2d Demo Project ###
  * border up the area to not let any leave
  * explicitly show that the bottom rectangle is to change object to be dropped

### Complete ###
  * add a texture to long box, maybe a plank of wood
  * create more static objects to have the objects run into
  * Touch does not line up with actual
  * Floor is invisible
  * Select which object to drop
  * Drop only one object per touch
  * Add textures to objects
  * Use accelerometer to affect gravity
  * Add new long box (stick) object
  * Show which object is to be dropped
